# DSA-MODULE-13
## AIM:
To Write a Python program to convert user given Infix expression to Postfix expression using stack, also by following the precedence and associative rule.
## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Define a class named 'Student'
3.	Declare a String variable 'name' and initialize it with the value "John"
4.	Declare a String variable 'address' and initialize it with the value "Chennai"
5.	Define a class named 'Test'
6.	Define the 'main' method within the 'Test' class
7.	Create an object 'obj' of the 'Student' class
8.	Print the value of 'name' and 'address' variables of the 'obj' object
9.	End



## PROGRAM:
 ```
/*
